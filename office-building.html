<h1 class="portfolio-headline">Office Building</h1>
<p class="portfolio-text">
    This is a multi floor office building with a main lobby with access on main street and a side street. The building contains two elevators and a staircase in the core for easy movement between floors. It is a basic square tower but with sharp shapes made up of curtain walls to add a visual aspect to a basic form. With one main curtain wall section that is on the corner of the building facing the main intersection is the highest  and the only section that is straight from the ground to the top of the building. This acts as a focal point for the building and sense of a traditional building before the other curtain wall sections appear to be breaking apart.
