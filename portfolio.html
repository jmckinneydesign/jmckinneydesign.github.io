<h1 class="portfolio-headline">East Haddam Firehouse</h1>
<p class="portfolio-text">
    A firehouse that I designed with a site in East Haddam, Connecticut, that has three sections to fulfill different purposes, each within a hierarchy. The three-bay engine room is the center and the most prominent of the three sections, because this area is the focus point of the purpose of a firehouse. This central area also has a loft where a firefighter can relax but also be close to the engine. The next section is residential with dorms, living quarters, kitchen, locker rooms and a conference room. The third and final section is the least prominent for conducting business, holding a front desk and offices for employees, as well as being a place for the public to inquire about various issues regarding the fire chief.
