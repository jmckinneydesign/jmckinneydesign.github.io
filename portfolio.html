<h1 class="portfolio-headline">East Haddam Firehouse</h1>
<p class="portfolio-text">
    A firehouse that I designed with a site in East Haddam, CT that has three sections to fulfill different purposes and they have a hierarchy. The three bay enging room is the center and the most prominent of the three sections, because this is where the main reason for haing a firehouse is held. Also having a loft where a firefighter can relay but also be close to the engine. The next section is residential with dorms, living quarters, kitchen, locker rooms and a conference room. The third and final section is also the least prominent is business, holding a front desk and offices for employees. A place for the public to inquire about various issues regarding the fire chief.
