        <p class="portfolio-text">
            Ever since I was younger, I always loved to design and building anything I could think of, from models, tree forts, river dams, snow forts with tunnel systems, and a seemingly endless supply of various structures from numerous different building toys. Growing up in Vermont's rural environments and having access to a variety of construction materials and knowledgeable individuals allowed me not only to design but build larger scale projects, to get them out of my head and created in reality. Whenever possible I would take drafting, design, and shop classes throughout middle and high school, and still couldn't get enough.

            Once it came time for college, it was an easy choice to pick Architecture as my major. All the same passions I had for design and building were elevated by being introduced to a new medium to work in with 3D modeling programs, which were a joy to learn and build in.

            Now that I have earned my Bachelor of Science in Engineering Architectural Design from the University of Hartford, I am ready to start working in the architectural field to become a licensed Architect.  I am also interested in getting more experience in sustainable design and green architecture.  In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, exercising and snowboarding. I am more than willing to relocate to start my career and I am excited to explore new places and meet new people.
