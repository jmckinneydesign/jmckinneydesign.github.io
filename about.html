        <p class="portfolio-text">
            I earned a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Architectural Design at the University of Hartford

            and now that I have attained my degree, I am enthusiastic about obtaining a position in the

            architectural field and working toward becoming a licensed Architect. During my first year of

            college, I concentrated my studies in Mechanical Engineering, but switched into architecture my

            sophomore year for more of a hands­on field of study versus a more calculative field as well as

            always expressing interest in building design. I enjoy; travailing, exercise, snowboarding, the

            outdoors design. I am more than willing to relocate to start my career and I am excited to see new

            places and meet new people.
