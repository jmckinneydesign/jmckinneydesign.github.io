        <p class="portfolio-text">
            I earned a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Architectural Design at the University of Hartford. Now that I have obtained my degree, I am enthustsiastic about pursuing a position in the architectural field to become a licensed Architect. During my first year of colleve, I concentrated my studies in Mechanical Engineering, but switched into architecture my sophomore year. I valued a more hands on field of engineering because I always expressed interest in building design and outdoor design. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, exercising and snowboarding. I am more than willing to relocate to start my career and I am excited to explore new places and meet new people.
