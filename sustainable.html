    This multi-purpose green building was designed with a location of Boulder, Colorado. Vasari was used for climate, sun, heating and cooling analysis. This building produces 80% of the energy needed to run it, achieving this by taking advantage of a sun space, trombe walls, solar panels, wind turbines, adjustable window shades and orientation of the building and windows to maximize efficiency. The first floor is two retail spaces and the second is two living spaces. The retail space has main street access and the living spaces have rear access with a parking lot off a side street.
